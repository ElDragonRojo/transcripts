Transcripts
===========

There is much value in having my interviews and presentations in text:

* It is another way to consume them
* It is another way to archive them
* It makes it possible to index and search them
* It makes it possible to relate things to each other
* There is probably some knowledge to be extracted
* There are probably some follow-ups to be added
